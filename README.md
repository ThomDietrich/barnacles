barnacles
=========


A real-time location & sensor data aggregator for the IoT
---------------------------------------------------------

__barnacles__ consume real-time spatio-temporal information about wireless devices and emit notification events based on changes such as appearances, displacements and disappearances.  __barnacles__ receive this information stream from [barnowl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl) and other __barnacles__ instances, and maintain the current state of all detected devices.  __barnacles__ ensure that contextual information propagates efficiently from a local to a global scale in the Internet of Things.

__In the scheme of Things (pun intended)__

The [barnowl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl), __barnacles__, [barterer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barterer) and [chickadee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chickadee) packages all work together as a unit, conveniently bundled as [hlc-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hlc-server).

What's in a name?
-----------------

As [Wikipedia so eloquently states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle#Sexual_reproduction), "To facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals, __barnacles__ have extraordinarily long penises."  And given the current state of isolation of nodes in today's IoT, this package (pun intended) needs "the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom".

Also, we hope the name provides occasions to overhear our Qu√©becois colleagues say things like "Tu veux tu configurer ta barnacle!?!"


Installation
------------

    npm install barnacles

__barnacles__ are tightly coupled with [barnowl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl), our IoT middleware package.  The latter provides a source of data to the former, as the following example will show. 


Hello barnacles & barnowl
-------------------------

```javascript
const Barnacles = require('barnacles');
const Barnowl = require('barnowl');

let barnowl = new Barnowl();
barnowl.addListener(Barnowl, {}, Barnowl.TestListener, {});

let barnacles = new Barnacles({ barnowl: barnowl });
```


What's next?
------------

The reelyActive team is currently overhauling barnacles for a v1.0.0 release. This is very much an active work in progress. If you're developing with barnacles check out:
