barnacles
=========


What's in a name?
-----------------

barnacles consume spatio-temporal data concerning wireless devices and emit notification events based on changes such as appearances, displacements and disappearances.  barnacles ensure that contextual information propagates efficiently from a local to a global scale in the Internet of Things.  Why the name?  As [Wikipedia so eloquently states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle#Sexual_reproduction), "To facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals, barnacles have extraordinarily long penises."  And given the current state of isolation of nodes in today's IoT, this package (pun intended) needs "the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom".

Also, we hope the name provides occasions to overhear our Qu√©becois colleagues say things like "Tu veux tu configurer ta barnacle!?!"

Installation
------------

    npm install barnacles

barnacles are tightly coupled with [barnowl](https://www.npmjs.org/package/barnowl), our IoT middleware package.  The latter provides a source of data to the former, as the following example will show. 


Hello barnacles & barnowl
-------------------------

```javascript
var barnacles = require('barnacles');
var barnowl = require('barnowl');

var notifications = new barnacles();
var middleware = new barnowl();

middleware.bind( { protocol: 'udp', path: '192.168.1.101:50000' } ); // See barnowl

notifications.bind({ barnowl: middleware });

notifications.on('appearance', function(tiraid) {
  console.log(tiraid.identifier.value + " has appeared on "
              + tiraid.radioDecodings[0].identifier.value);
});

notifications.on('displacement', function(tiraid) {
  console.log(tiraid.identifier.value + " has displaced to "
              + tiraid.radioDecodings[0].identifier.value);
});

notifications.on('disappearance', function(tiraid) {
  console.log(tiraid.identifier.value + " has disappeared from "
              + tiraid.radioDecodings[0].identifier.value);
});
```

When the above code is run with a valid (and active) data stream as input to barnowl, you should see output to the console similar to the following:

    001bc50940100000 has appeared on 001bc50940800000
    001bc50940100000 has displaced to 001bc50940800001
    001bc50940100000 has disappeared from 001bc50940800001


Options
-------

The following options are supported when instantiating barnacles (those shown are the defaults):

    {
      disappearanceMilliseconds: 10000
    }

Notes:
- none
